#cs2504-algorithms-assignments

Four assignments completed for the University College Cork module CS2504 taught by Dr. Kieran Herley. Provided on Github as CS2504 is no longer taught. Information on the assignments and course located [here](http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~kieran/cs2504/). I received a first class honours grade of 86% in the module having received the following marks in each assignment:

* Assignment 1: 9/10
* Assignment 2: 9/10
* Assignment 3: 9/10
* Assignment 4: 10/10

I've provided my solutions here *as submitted* with no changes made. I have removed some of the code provided with the assignments that was to be used as boilerplate; as such much of this will not compile on its own.
